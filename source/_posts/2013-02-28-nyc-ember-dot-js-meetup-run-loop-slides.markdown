Just did a talk on the Ember run loop at the 
[NYC Ember.js Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/EmberJS-NYC/). 
You can check them out
[here](http://machty.github.com/blog/ember_run_loop_talk).
There's also a blurb on the `ember-source`, `handlebars-source` stuff 
I [wrote about
yesterday](/blog/2013/02/27/gemifying-ember-dot-js-slash-handlebars-dot-js-slash-etc-dot-js/).
