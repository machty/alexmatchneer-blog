Long time no blog, been busy with Ember stuff. Much has transpired since
the last post, including getting added to Ember Core, making the Ember
router reasonable, and other things. About time I get back into the
blog-groove. Don't expect quality; I'm probably gonna use this to jot
down daily learnings because I am immensely forgetful, which rears its
ugly head when I spend hours / days on a hard problem, only to forget
the various realizations that would prevent me from having to solve the
same shit over and over again. It's gotten pretty bad; hopefully this
will help.
