Here's a progressively-updated list of things I forget throughout the
day. This is different from the list of things I've learned; that
approach is useful for packing the things into my brain, hopefully; the
purpose of this list is to pack things back in when I forget. And for
now it'll just be one giant progressively-updated blog.
