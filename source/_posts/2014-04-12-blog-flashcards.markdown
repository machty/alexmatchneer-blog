I'm a very forgetful person and have been looking for a way to integrate
flashcards into my daily routine as a means of keeping track of the
random dev-related things I learn throughout the day, and I think I've
finally cracked the nut:

I've built flashcards into this blog: specifically, for each entry in
this Jekyll/Octopress-based static site, I can optionally specify a list
of flashcards in the YAML configuration, and these flashcards get
compiled at site generation/deployment time and uploaded to
[Cram](http://Cram.com), a free site for hosting flashcards (they also
have nice iOS/Android apps). 

The point of all of this is that part of the blog-writing process will
be to jot down some quick flashcards for myself and everyone else who
might be interested in having a quizzable TL;DR for each entry. Of
course, it all comes down to how committed I remain to writing regular
blog entries, but I think it's a pretty cool idea and I'd love it if
other bloggers I followed did something similar (or accepted pull
requests from community flashcard-writers). 

You can check out all the flashcards associated with this blog
